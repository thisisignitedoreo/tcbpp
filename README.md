<h1 align=center>Warning</h1>

This project is no longer maintained. If you encounter any bugs - i will not fix it.
If you want "okay, i guess" clickbot check out [RE clickbot](https://github.com/tobyadd/clicks/),
on which I actively work. (Note: it's CLI only, no fancy-shmancy GUI's and stuff)

If you want you can still use this one, but it may be buggy. Enjoy, if you will. )/
